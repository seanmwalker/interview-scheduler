#TODO

Date, change this readme to mark the items that you have completed.

  - Add a new file under the path of lib/dante.js with any javascript you want to add.
  - Update the file lib/sean.js to fix the javacsript error.
  - After you add the new dante.js file, make some changes to dante.js locally and commit them (locally) but do not push them to the server. I will later make a change so you can see the diff and merge process.
  - Also make some changes to the sean.js file after you push the above fix to the server. But this time don't commit it locally. This will show you another path through the process of merging etc...
  - Update this readme file to reflect the changes you made by adding "DONE: " to the beginning of each line.


When I see these marked complete, I'll make some changes and then you can go through the next set listed here.
